# Robotics

In robotics, I found this much desired intersection between Mathematics and coding. I worked at [Delian](https://delian.ai/) for two years, where I ended up owning a good portion of the perception stack for the [LAST](https://delian.ai/products/last). I got to work on various computer vision and computational geometry problems, some of my favorites include:

## Ray Tracing
- CPU only single threaded ray tracer on resource-restricted edge compute devices.
- Custom memory-light acceleration data structures.
- 97% decreased runtime compared to pre-made library for meshes up to 100x in size.
- Custom modular tiles, ready to deploy anywhere.

## Mission Planning
- Built on top of the ray tracer.
- Custom algorithms for occlusion and clustering.
- Optimized path planning for scanning areas of interest.

## Sensor Fusion
- Integration of various different sensors.
- Unified probabilistic model for all objects.
- Asynchronous sources of truth.

Most of my solutions were in pure C, but our framework was ROS2 with C++. I also got to build a lot of prototypes and custom simulation environemnts in Python.

I think I will always have a soft spot for robotics, regardless of how annoying working with hardware can get.
